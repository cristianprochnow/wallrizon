## Getting Started

Fill your `.env` (create this file in project's root directory) file with your [**Nasa API Key**][nasa-api-url] in `API_KEY` property, like below.
```env
# .env

API_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```

Then, install packages to run project.
```
$ npm install
```

And finally run project ðŸš€
```
npx react-native start
```

> If you want to run directly on **Android**, so just run `npx react-native run-android`.

Enjoy!
